# SEO Keyword Queue for Daily Article Generation
# One keyword per line. The scheduler pops the top keyword each day,
# then rotates it to the bottom (round-robin, never exhausted).
# Add/remove keywords freely. Lines starting with # are ignored.
#
# Tips:
#   - Mix informational ("how to"), commercial ("best X"), and comparison ("X vs Y") queries
#   - Target keywords with clear business intent (easier to monetize)
#   - Aim for 1,000–10,000 monthly searches (lower competition than mega-keywords)
